Assumptions:

I have assumed distance for delivery cannot exceed 1000kms (just for sake)
Same goes with time (both de idle time and order waiting time)
I have assumed priorites as indexes like say 37.5 for distnce
boundaryDistance:1000
boundaryDETime:180
boundaryOrderTime:180
priorityDist:37.5
priorityDETime:33.5
priorityOrderTime:29.5

And given a list I have created a ranking system and heap based structure for distributing orders.
